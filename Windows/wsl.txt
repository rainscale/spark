1、vim启动报错Cannot set language to "zh_CN.utf-8"
$ sudo apt install language-pack-zh-hans

2、编译wsl2 kernel
https://github.com/microsoft/WSL2-Linux-Kernel
Instructions for building an x86_64 WSL2 kernel with an Ubuntu distribution are as follows:

Install the build dependencies:
$ sudo apt install build-essential flex bison dwarves libssl-dev libelf-dev cpio

Modify WSL2 kernel configs (optional):
$ make menuconfig KCONFIG_CONFIG=Microsoft/config-wsl

Loadable module support is disabled when using a custom built kernel. Set any modules you want to be built-in before building.

Build the kernel using the WSL2 kernel configuration:
$ make KCONFIG_CONFIG=Microsoft/config-wsl
编译完成后内核文件bzImage，在%编译目录%/arch/x86/boot/内可以找到。
$ uname -a
Linux Godlin 5.15.153.1-microsoft-standard-WSL2 #1 SMP Sat Oct 26 10:04:33 CST 2024 x86_64 x86_64 x86_64 GNU/Linux

Configure global settings with .wslconfig across all installed distributions running on WSL.
The .wslconfig file does not exist by default. It must be created and stored in your %UserProfile% directory to apply these configuration settings.
Used to configure settings globally across all installed Linux distributions running as the WSL 2 version.
Can be used only for distributions run by WSL 2. Distributions running as WSL 1 will not be affected by this configuration as they are not running as a virtual machine.
To get to your %UserProfile% directory, in PowerShell, use cd ~ to access your home directory (which is typically your user profile, C:\Users\<UserName>) or you can open Windows File Explorer and enter %UserProfile% in the address bar. The directory path should look something like: C:\Users\<UserName>\.wslconfig.
WSL will detect the existence of these files, read the contents, and automatically apply the configuration settings every time you launch WSL. If the file is missing or malformed (improper markup formatting), WSL will continue to launch as normal without the configuration settings applied.

.wslconfig example:
# Settings apply across all Linux distros running on WSL 2
[wsl2]

# Limits VM memory to use no more than 4 GB, this can be set as whole numbers using GB or MB
memory=4GB 

# Sets the VM to use two virtual processors
processors=2

# Specify a custom Linux kernel to use with your installed distros. The default kernel used can be found at https://github.com/microsoft/WSL2-Linux-Kernel
kernel=C:\\temp\\myCustomKernel

# Sets additional kernel parameters, in this case enabling older Linux base images such as Centos 6
kernelCommandLine = vsyscall=emulate

# Sets amount of swap storage space to 8GB, default is 25% of available RAM
swap=8GB

# Sets swapfile path location, default is %USERPROFILE%\AppData\Local\Temp\swap.vhdx
swapfile=C:\\temp\\wsl-swap.vhdx

# Disable page reporting so WSL retains all allocated memory claimed from Windows and releases none back when free
pageReporting=false

# Turn on default connection to bind WSL 2 localhost to Windows localhost. Setting is ignored when networkingMode=mirrored
localhostforwarding=true

# Disables nested virtualization
nestedVirtualization=false

# Turns on output console showing contents of dmesg when opening a WSL 2 distro for debugging
debugConsole=true

# Enable experimental features
[experimental]
sparseVhd=true
